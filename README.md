# Semantos — Autonomous AI Learning on Provable On-Chain Data

> Agents that learn from cryptographically verifiable datasets, evolve their strategies in real-time, deploy policy updates as auditable on-chain state transitions, and compete against each other — with every decision justified by provable training data.

## What This Is

This is **not** a poker game. Poker is the data generator — a high-churn environment that produces millions of meaningful state transitions on BSV mainnet. The actual system is:

1. **A provable training data pipeline** — every game state transition (deal, flop, turn, river, showdown) is a LINEAR CellToken on-chain, hash-chained to the previous state. The dataset is immutable, auditable, and verifiable by any third party.

2. **Autonomous AI agents that learn from that data** — apex predators observe the floor via shadow loops, run opponent analysis, compute vulnerability scores, and feed it all to an LLM that proposes strategy upgrades.

3. **Hot-swappable policy evolution with on-chain provenance** — each policy version is itself a CellToken, hash-linked to the training data that produced it. When an agent changes its strategy, you can trace *exactly* which on-chain observations led to that decision.

4. **Agent-vs-agent competition with quantifiable results** — multiple AI models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) compete on the same floor. Their policy evolution chains diverge based on different LLM reasoning over the same provable dataset. Settlement CellTokens record who won, how much, and which policy version was active.

5. **Kernel-enforced cheat detection** — a rogue agent runs 5 exploit classes against the system. The 2PDA kernel validates every state transition and catches invalid moves. Cheat attempts are logged as CellTokens — the detection itself is on-chain evidence.

6. **Hub-and-spoke payment channels with auditable tick proofs** — bilateral payment channels don't work when 4 players share a communal pot. We solve this with a hub-and-spoke design: the table engine is the central counterparty, and each player opens a 2-of-2 multisig channel with the table. Bets tick the bettor's channel (player→table), pot awards tick the winner's channel (table→player). Every tick is HMAC-SHA256 authenticated and emits a CellToken transition (v_n → v_{n+1}) on-chain. The internal channel mechanism is fully auditable — you can trace every satoshi through the state chain. Settlement closes all N channels with an 8-state FSM (NEGOTIATING→FUNDED→ACTIVE→PAUSED→CLOSING→SETTLED/DISPUTED).

## Why This Matters

Current AI systems learn from opaque datasets and deploy policies with no audit trail. You can't verify what data trained a model, what reasoning produced a decision, or whether the outcome was legitimate.

This system makes every link in the chain verifiable:

```
On-chain game state (CellTokens)
  → Opponent analysis (vulnerability scoring)
    → LLM prompt (with training data references)
      → New policy (Lisp S-expression, hash-chained)
        → Deployment (atomic hot-swap, zero downtime)
          → Quantifiable results (settlement CellTokens)
            → Next training cycle (feeds back into the loop)
```

Every arrow is auditable. Every CellToken is on BSV mainnet. Every policy version points back to the data that justified it.

## CellToken Protocol

A CellToken is a 1,024-byte typed data cell encoded as a PushDrop output on BSV:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ HEADER (256 bytes)                       │
│  Magic: DEADBEEF CAFEBABE 13371337 42424242 │
│  Linearity: LINEAR (single-owner, no copy)│
│  Version: monotonic (1, 2, 3...)         │
│  Type Hash: SHA-256 of the cell schema   │
│  Owner: pubkey of the controlling agent  │
│  Prev State Hash: chain link to parent   │
│  Content Hash: integrity check           │
│  Semantic Path: semantos:game/poker/...  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ PAYLOAD (768 bytes)                      │
│  JSON game state:                        │
│  {                                       │
│    "gameId": "table-0-1234",             │
│    "handNumber": 42,                     │
│    "phase": "showdown",                  │
│    "pot": 150,                           │
│    "players": [...],                     │
│    "communityCards": ["Ah","Kd","7s"...] │
│  }                                       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each hand produces a chain of 5 CellTokens:

```
deal (v=1) → flop (v=2) → turn (v=3) → river (v=4) → showdown (v=5)
     │            │            │            │              │
     └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴──────────────┘
     Hash-chained: each cell's prevStateHash = SHA-256(previous cell)
```

LINEAR linearity means each cell can only be spent once — the game state can't be forked or double-spent. After settlement, OP_DEMOTE downgrades to RELEVANT (read-only permanent record).

## Policy Evolution Chain

When an apex agent upgrades its strategy, the new policy is recorded as a CellToken:

```
Policy v1 (baseline)
  ↓ training data: 50 hands from floor, vulnerability scores
Policy v2 (LLM: "increase aggression against passive opponents")
  ↓ training data: 80 hands, 3 opponents profiled
Policy v3 (LLM: "exploit tight-passive player at seat 2")
  ↓ results: +340 chips over 30 hands
Policy v4 (LLM: "broaden target selection, seat 2 eliminated")
```

Each version includes:
- The Lisp policy source (S-expression)
- Hash of the training data that produced it
- References to specific CellTokens used for training
- Vulnerability analysis snapshot
- Previous policy hash (chain integrity)

This means you can pick any policy version and trace backwards: *"This strategy was produced by Claude Sonnet analysing hands #1042-#1122, which showed opponent X folding 78% of the time to river bets. The full hand data is on-chain at these CellToken txids."*

## Cheat Detection

The rogue agent (apex-4) runs 5 exploit classes:

1. **Phantom raise** — claims to raise more chips than it has
2. **Action replay** — replays a previous hand's actions
3. **Pot manipulation** — submits incorrect pot totals
4. **Turn skip** — tries to skip from flop directly to showdown
5. **Identity spoof** — acts as a different player

The 2PDA kernel validates every transition against the compiled poker policies. Invalid transitions are rejected and logged as cheat-attempt CellTokens — the detection evidence is itself on-chain.

The dashboard shows caught vs undetected attempts in real-time, and the audit CSV includes every attempt with its CellToken hash.

## Paskian Learning — Swarm Pattern Detection

The floor bots aren't static — each has a **SwarmEMA** (Exponential Moving Average, α=0.05) that tracks its win rate and chip delta over time. When a bot loses consistently, the EMA tightens its play (higher fold threshold, lower aggression). When it wins, the EMA loosens it. This creates a **negative feedback loop**: the entire swarm converges toward equilibrium without any central coordination.

The **Paskian Learning Layer** sits above this swarm and observes the emergent behavior. It ingests four signal types from the border-router:

| Signal | Source | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| `SWARM_WINNING` | EMA drift > +0.05 | `drift × 4` (normalized to [-1, 1]) |
| `SWARM_LOSING` | EMA drift < -0.05 | `drift × 4` |
| `SWARM_STABLE` | EMA drift ≈ 0 | `drift × 4` |
| `HAND_WON` / `HAND_LOST` / `FOLD` / `RAISE` | Per-hand reports | Pot-normalized |

Paskian tracks per-node state using its own EMA (configurable learning rate) and detects two kinds of behavioral threads:

**Stable Threads** — converged patterns where a cluster of nodes shows low variance:

```
Stable Thread: "Converged: SWARM_WINNING"
  Nodes: [bot-aggressive, bot-tight]
  Stability: 0.97
  Observation: "2 players consistently winning (avg strength 0.312).
    Swarm has converged on effective strategies — the EMA adaptation
    has found a stable equilibrium."
```

**Emerging Threads** — trends developing within a time window:

```
Emerging Thread: "Emerging: Swarm Pressure"
  Nodes: [bot-passive, bot-random]
  Stability: 0.30
  Observation: "2 players showing declining trend. Competitive pressure
    from adapted opponents is pushing their win rates down —
    the swarm is reshuffling."
```

The detection algorithm:
1. Group nodes by behavioral kind (WINNING/LOSING/STABLE)
2. For each group with ≥2 nodes and ≥5 history entries, compute variance of strength history
3. If variance < ε (configurable), the group is a **stable thread**
4. For emerging threads: check if the last 5 strength values are monotonically increasing or decreasing (Δ > 0.01)
5. Detect dominant states when one kind has >2× the player count of any other

This is exposed via the dashboard at `/api/paskian/stable-threads` and `/api/paskian/emerging-threads`, auto-refreshing every 2 seconds.

**Why this matters for the hackathon**: the floor bots aren't just generating transaction volume — they're producing *detectable behavioral patterns* that a higher-order system (Paskian) can observe and report on. The apex predators consume these observations when deciding which floor tables to target. It's agents observing agents observing agents — all grounded in on-chain provable data.

**Tested with 26 tests and 64 assertions** covering: EMA smoothing, stable thread detection (winning/losing/stable clusters), emerging trend detection (improving/declining), dominant state detection, high-variance rejection, threshold enforcement (minInteractions, history length), realistic 100-hand swarm simulation, and human-readable observation output.

## Payment Channels — Hub-and-Spoke

Traditional payment channels are bilateral: Alice opens a channel with Bob, they exchange signed state updates off-chain, and settle on-chain when done. This doesn't work for multi-player poker — when 4 players bet into a communal pot, you'd need O(n²) bilateral channels and there's no clean way to route pot winnings.

We solve this with a **hub-and-spoke** architecture:

```
                    Table Engine (hub)
                   /    |    |    \
           2-of-2  2-of-2  2-of-2  2-of-2
              /      |       |        \
        Player 0  Player 1  Player 2  Player 3
```

Each player has exactly **one** channel with the table engine. The table acts as the pot custodian:

| Action | Channel Flow | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| Player bets 100 sats | Tick on that player's channel | Player → Table |
| Player calls 50 sats | Tick on that player's channel | Player → Table |
| Player goes all-in | Tick on that player's channel | Player → Table |
| Winner gets 400 pot | Tick on winner's channel | Table → Player |
| Fold / Check | No tick (zero sats move) | — |

Every tick produces an **HMAC-SHA256 tick proof** — a cryptographic receipt binding the channel ID, tick number, cumulative satoshis, and shared secret. These proofs are the audit trail:

```
TickProof {
  channelId: "ch_a4f7x2k1q",
  tick: 7,
  cumulativeSatoshis: 450,
  hmac: "3f8a91c2...",    // HMAC-SHA256(channelId:tick:sats, sharedSecret)
  timestamp: 1713168000000
}
```

Each channel runs through an **8-state FSM**:

```
NEGOTIATING → FUNDED → ACTIVE → PAUSED ↔ ACTIVE
                                   ↓
                         CLOSING_REQUESTED → CLOSING_CONFIRMED → SETTLED
                                   ↓                    ↓
                              DISPUTED ──────────→ SETTLED (via resolve)
```

At table close, all channels settle simultaneously. The settlement includes:
- All tick proofs (HMAC-authenticated state chain)
- Per-channel net flow (bets vs awards)
- Final FSM state transition

The hub-and-spoke design is **tested with 24 tests and 87 assertions** covering 2-player through 6-player tables, cumulative pot tracking, independent channel state per player, full settlement lifecycle, and callback integration with the table engine.

## IPv6 Multicast — Peer Discovery & Cell Propagation

Floor nodes and apex predators don't talk through a central server — they communicate via **IPv6 UDP multicast** using CoAP-like framing. Each node joins a multicast group, discovers peers via heartbeats, and propagates CellTokens and control messages across the mesh in real-time.

### How It Works

```
Node 0 (floor)                    Node 1 (floor)                    Node 2 (apex)
    │                                  │                                  │
    ├── heartbeat (botIndex=0) ───────→│←─────── heartbeat (botIndex=1) ──┤
    │←─────── heartbeat (botIndex=1) ──┤── heartbeat (botIndex=2) ───────→│
    │                                  │                                  │
    │   Peers: [1, 2]                  │   Peers: [0, 2]                  │   Peers: [0, 1]
    │                                  │                                  │
    ├── publish(CellToken) ───────────→│←──── (received + stored) ────────┤
    │                                  │──── publish(CellToken) ─────────→│
```

**Protocol details:**
- **12-byte CoAP-like header**: version (1 byte), message type (1 byte), token length (2 bytes), bot index (2 bytes), sequence number (2 bytes), payload length (4 bytes)
- **Message types**: `0x01` heartbeat (peer discovery), `0x02` cell publication, `0x03` control message
- **CBOR serialization** for payloads (compact binary encoding)
- **BCA derivation**: each node derives a deterministic IPv6 address from its bot index (`deriveBCA(index)`)

### Peer Discovery

Nodes emit heartbeats on startup and at configurable intervals. When a node receives a heartbeat from an unknown peer, it adds it to its peer table. Stale peers (no heartbeat within the timeout window) are automatically evicted.

Self-suppression prevents nodes from discovering themselves as peers — heartbeats from the same bot index are silently dropped.

### Control Messages

Beyond cell propagation, nodes exchange structured control messages for coordination:

| Control Type | Purpose | Flow |
|---|---|---|
| `TABLE_PROPOSAL` | Floor node proposes forming a table | Broadcast |
| `TABLE_ACK` | Peer accepts the table proposal | Unicast to proposer |
| `TABLE_CONFIRM` | Proposer confirms the table is formed | Broadcast to participants |

This three-phase protocol enables **decentralized table formation** — no central coordinator assigns players to tables. Nodes discover each other via multicast, negotiate table composition, and confirm formation, all over UDP.

### Unicast + Resolution

In addition to multicast, nodes can send messages directly to a specific peer via `sendToNode(targetBotIndex, message)`. Peers are resolved by their BCA (Bot Cell Address) using `resolveBCA(ipv6Address)`, which maps IPv6 addresses back to peer metadata.

### Testing

The multicast layer is **tested with 23 tests and 73 assertions** covering:
- Header encode/decode round-tripping (all message types, max values)
- BCA derivation (determinism, correctness)
- Peer discovery (2-node, 3-node mesh, self-suppression)
- Cell publication and cross-node reception (delivery, storage, self-filtering)
- Topic-based subscription (filtering, unsubscribe)
- Control messages (delivery, three-phase table formation protocol)
- Unicast to specific peers + BCA resolution
- 4-node mesh simulation (full connectivity)
- Concurrent publications from multiple nodes

All tests use `LoopbackUdpTransport` — an in-process test double that shares the exact same interface as `RealUdpTransport` (node:dgram sockets). The loopback transport routes messages through a shared registry with `queueMicrotask` for async delivery fidelity, proving the multicast logic works without requiring real UDP sockets.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) + Docker Compose
- BSV for live mode (0.5-5 BSV depending on target tx count)

### Quick Start (Stub Mode — No BSV)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/todriguez/hackathon-submission.git
cd hackathon-submission
bun install

# Dry run — all game logic runs, CellTokens created in memory, no broadcasts
docker compose up -d

# Watch the dashboard
open http://localhost:9090
```

### Live Mode (BSV Mainnet)

```bash
# 1. Generate a funding address
bun run show-address

# 2. Send BSV to that address (0.5 BSV = ~350K CellTokens, 5 BSV = ~3.5M)

# 3. Split into per-container UTXOs
PRIVATE_KEY_WIF=L3xxx... bun run pre-fund

# 4. Launch with the generated .env.live
docker compose --env-file .env.live up -d

# 5. Monitor
open http://localhost:9090

# 6. Export audit data when done
./scripts/export-audit.sh
```

### What You'll See

**Dashboard** at `http://localhost:9090/`:
- Live tx count, CellTokens/sec, fee spend
- CellToken overlay stats (phase breakdown, chain depth)
- Apex predator policy evolution (Lisp source, version history)
- Agent-vs-agent matchup results (head-to-head W/L by model)
- Cheat attempts (caught/undetected, exploit type)
- Premium hands (quads, straight flush, royal flush)
- Transaction DAG (CellToken chains per hand)
- CSV export buttons for hackathon audit

## Transaction Budget

| Component | Txs | Fee/tx | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Floor CellTokens | ~2.5M | ~135 sats | 5 per hand × 128 tables × 2000 hands × restarts |
| Floor OP_RETURNs | ~2.5M | ~30 sats | Anchor commitments |
| Payment channel ticks | ~5M+ | ~135 sats | ~10 bets/hand × 128 tables × 2000+ hands |
| Channel open/settle | ~1K | ~250 sats | 2-of-2 multisig fund + settle per table session |
| Apex policy CellTokens | ~200 | ~135 sats | Per roam upgrade |
| Cheat detection CellTokens | ~50 | ~135 sats | Rogue agent attempts |
| Pre-split fan-outs | ~96 | ~3K sats | UTXO distribution |
| **Target total** | **1.5M+** | | **~0.5-1.5 BSV in fees** |

Fee rate: 0.1 sat/byte (TAAL + GorillaPool policy). CellToken tx: ~1,345 bytes.

## Formal Verification (Plexus VM)

The `opcodes/` directory contains the Plexus VM opcodes that enforce CellToken semantics natively in script:

- **`opcodes/zig/plexus.zig`** — Full implementation of 13 opcodes (0xC0-0xCC)
- **`opcodes/tests/new_plexus_conformance.zig`** — Conformance test suite
- **`opcodes/lean-opcodes/`** — Lean4 formal specifications
- **`opcodes/lean-theorems/`** — Lean4 proofs:
  - `CellImmutabilityK7` — cells cannot be modified after creation
  - `DemotionK8` — linearity can only decrease (LINEAR→AFFINE→RELEVANT)
  - `TemporalMorphismK9` — state transitions preserve temporal ordering
  - `TuringCompletenessK10` — the 2PDA+stack system is Turing complete
- **`opcodes/tla/`** — TLA+ model checking specifications

Today the CellTokens use PushDrop for mainnet compatibility. When miners adopt the Plexus opcodes, the same state transitions get miner-enforced linearity — no application code changes needed.

## Dependencies

Only two npm packages:
- `@bsv/sdk` — BSV cryptography, transaction building, ARC broadcasting
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk` — Claude API for policy evolution (apex only)

Everything else is self-contained. Zero monorepo dependencies.
